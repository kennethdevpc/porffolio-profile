**IMPORTANT:** It is necessary to have at least the latest stable version of Node and NPM. Make sure you have it in order to correctly install the dependencies needed to run the project.

Currently the required versions are:

- **Node**: I used v18.10.0
- **NPM**: >6.14.16

To check which version you have installed:

> node -v
>
> npm -v

#### Tecnologías usadas:

## Back notas:

## Execution file:

to run the back and front file, you just have to install the dependencies, then you have to go to the folder from the terminal and execute:

```

npm install

```

and once the dependencies are installed, run the application, both front and back

```

npm start

```

If you want to deploy your application:

```

npm run build

```
